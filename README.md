# Overview

`pixl-boot` will automatically register a startup service for your module on Linux and OS X, so your daemon will be started on a server reboot.  It is configured entirely out of your [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) file, and will handle all the details of registering a [systemd service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) on Linux, or a [LaunchAgent/LaunchDaemon](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html) on OS X.

This is only designed for packages that are installed as the root user.

# Usage

First, add the `pixl-boot` package in the `dependencies` section of your `package.json` file:

```js
"dependencies": {
	"pixl-boot": "^2.0.0"
}
```

Next, you need to provide a shell script for starting and stopping your background daemon.  This can be a simple bash (or Node.js) script that responds to `start` and `stop` commands on the CLI.  If you do not have one of these scripts we provide a sample one for you (instructions below).

Once you have your control script ready, link to it in the `bin` property in your `package.json` file:

```js
"bin": "bin/control.sh",
```

Finally, you need to have npm run `pixl-boot` on install and uninstall of your package, so that it has a chance to register and unregister your startup service.  Do this by adding `postinstall` and `preuninstall` properties in the `scripts` section of your `package.json` file:

```js
"scripts": {
	"postinstall": "pixl-boot install",
	"preuninstall": "pixl-boot uninstall"
}
```

That's it!

Alternatively, if you would rather the startup service not be installed automatically, and instead require additional user commands, change the `scripts` property names to something custom, like `boot` and `unboot`:

```js
"scripts": {
	"boot": "pixl-boot install",
	"unboot": "pixl-boot uninstall"
}
```

Then your users would need to be instructed to type:

```
npm run boot
npm run unboot
```

To install and uninstall the startup service, respectively.

## Advanced

The `pixl-boot install` and `pixl-boot uninstall` commands accept some optional CLI arguments which you can add if desired:

### name

Add `--name` if you want to customize the startup service name.  This defaults to the `name` property from your `package.json` file, and is converted to lower-case alphanumeric.  Make sure you add this to both the install and uninstall commands.  Example:

```js
"scripts": {
	"postinstall": "pixl-boot install --name mycustomservice",
	"preuninstall": "pixl-boot uninstall --name mycustomservice"
}
```

### company

Add `--company` if you want to customize the "company" (organization) name that goes into your startup service metadata.  This defaults to the word `Node`, and may be displayed as part of your package description, depending on the OS.  This is really just a cosmetic detail that has no operational effect on your service.  Make sure you add this to both the install and uninstall commands.  Example use:

```js
"scripts": {
	"postinstall": "pixl-boot install --company MyCompany",
	"preuninstall": "pixl-boot uninstall --company MyCompany"
}
```

### script

Add `--script` to specify a custom location of your shell control script, relative to the base directory of your package.  Use this option if you do not want to pull this from the `bin` property in your `package.json` file.  You only need to add this to the `pixl-boot install` command.  Example:

```js
"scripts": {
	"postinstall": "pixl-boot install --script bin/my-control-script.sh"
}
```

### linux_type

Add `--linux_type` if you want to customize the Linux systemd service type.  It should be one of `simple`, `forking`, `oneshot`, `dbus`, `notify`, or `idle`.  It defaults to `forking`.  Example:

```js
"scripts": {
	"postinstall": "pixl-boot install --linux_type forking"
}
```

### linux_after

Add `--linux_after` if you want to specify a service that we must start *after*.  This defaults to `network.target`, denoting that the server should have basic networking started before trying to start our service.  Example:

```js
"scripts": {
	"postinstall": "pixl-boot install --linux_after network.target"
}
```

### linux_wanted_by

Add `--linux_wanted_by` if you want to customize the `WantedBy` property in the systemd service file.  This defaults to `multi-user.target`.  Example:

```js
"scripts": {
	"postinstall": "pixl-boot install --linux_wanted_by multi-user.target"
}
```

### darwin_type

Add `--darwin_type` to customize the type of startup service you want on Darwin (OS X) systems.  Darwin supports two different types of startup services, [LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html).  In short, a `LaunchAgent` only starts up when a user log in, while a `LaunchDaemon` starts up earlier, before any user logs in.  The default type is `LaunchAgent`, but beware of changing this to `LaunchDaemon`, because this may start your service before things like network are available.  You only need to add this to the `pixl-boot install` command.  Example:

```js
"scripts": {
	"postinstall": "pixl-boot install --darwin_type LaunchAgent"
}
```

## Sample Shell Control Script

Your module is expected to provide a simple shell (or Node.js) control script, which will start and stop your daemon based on CLI commands.  Stopping your daemon from a shell script is usually accomplished by using a [PID File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_identifier#Pidfile).  If you do not have one of these scripts handy, we provide a sample one for you:

[sample-control.sh](https://github.com/jhuckaby/pixl-boot/blob/master/sample-control.sh)

Copy this script to your package directory (typically in a `bin` subdirectory but doesn't have to be), name it whatever you want, and configure these three lines near the top of the file:

```sh
NAME="YOUR_SERVICE_NAME_HERE"
BINARY="node lib/main.js"
PIDFILE="logs/pid.txt"
```

Set `NAME` to your service's name (just used for display purposes during startup / shutdown).  Set `BINARY` to the shell command used to actually launch your Node.js daemon (relative to your package base directory).  And finally, set `PIDFILE` to the location of your daemon's PID file. 

Your Node.js daemon is expected to fork a daemon (background) process when launched, and write out its own PID file after forking.  An easy way to do this is to use the npm [daemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/daemon) package, and then call `fs.writeFileSync()` for the PID file.  Example:

```js
// forks a daemon process and exits main process
require('daemon')();

// write PID file after forking
require('fs').writeFileSync( "logs/pid.txt", process.pid );
```

## JavaScript API

In addition to the command-line interface for `pixl-boot` there is also a JavaScript API you can use in your Node.js code, to install and/or uninstall startup services.  To use this, first call `require('pixl-boot)` to load the module, and the returned object exposes `install()` and `uninstall()` functions.  Both functions accept an options object, and a callback.  The options object accepts all the named command-line arguments, sans the hyphens.  Example use:

```js
var boot = require('pixl-boot');
var opts = {
	name: "MyService",
	company: "Node",
	script: "bin/control.sh",
	linux_type: "forking",
	linux_after: "network.target",
	linux_wanted_by: "multi-user.target",
	darwin_type: "agent"
};

// install startup service
boot.install(opts, function(err) {
	if (err) throw err;
} );

// uninstall startup service
boot.uninstall(opts, function(err) {
	if (err) throw err;
} );
```
